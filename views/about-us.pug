        | Keystone was started by Lynbrook juniors Renee Mok and Iris Leung on March 28, 2020 
        | in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 
        | Within a few days, we had established our core team, launched our website, amassed 
        | around 50 mentors, and began mentee sign-ups.

        | Our initial vision was to bridge the gap between Lynbrook and Miller students by 
        | providing support through peer mentorship. A Keystone is the central stone at 
        | the summit of a bridge/arch that is placed at the very end to lock all units together. 
        | We chose this name to emphasize how we link Miller and Lynbrook students together 
        | while also offering tips and advice (ex. what clubs there are on campus, what students 
        | should pay attention to with specific teachers, what sports are offered/what practices 
        | look like, etc.) that other more traditional tutoring services are unable to offer. 
        | However, since then we have extended our reach past these two schools to ensure that 
        | we can offer our services to as many students as possible.
